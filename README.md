# INTRODUCTION

Calculating the run time of various algorithms for larger inputs.


## SELECTION SORT
The selection sort algorithm sorts an array by repeatedly finding the minimum element (considering ascending order) from unsorted part and putting it at the beginning. The algorithm maintains two subarrays in a given array.
The subarray which is already sorted. 
Remaining subarray which is unsorted.
In every iteration of selection sort, the minimum element (considering ascending order) from the unsorted subarray is picked and moved to the sorted subarray. 
## TOWERS OF HANOI
Tower of Hanoi is a mathematical puzzle where we have three rods (A, B, and C) and N disks. Initially, all the disks are stacked in decreasing value of diameter i.e., the smallest disk is placed on the top and they are on rod A. The objective of the puzzle is to move the entire stack to another rod (here considered C), obeying the following simple rules: 
Only one disk can be moved at a time.
Each move consists of taking the upper disk from one of the stacks and placing it on top of another stack i.e. a disk can only be moved if it is the uppermost disk on a stack.
No disk may be placed on top of a smaller disk.
## SUM OF AN ARRAY
We are to add the elements of the array recursively and after the base case is reached,we have to return the first element and return until all recursive calls end.
## Horner Rule
Horner’s rule is an algorithm for evaluating a polynomial of the form cn​x^n+c(n−1)​x^(n−1)+⋯+c1​x+c0​
 at a given value of x
, where cn​,cn−1​,…,c0​
 are coefficients. The algorithm is based on the observation that the polynomial can be rewritten as ((⋯((cn​x+cn−1​)x+cn−2​)x+⋯)x+c1​)x+c0​
, which reduces the number of multiplications and additions needed to compute the values.
## Truth table for n numbers
It computes all possible boolean values of the number.
